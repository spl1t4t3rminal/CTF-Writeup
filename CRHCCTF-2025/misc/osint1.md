given a picture. It looks like this is a large grassland and behind it is a mountain. I was given a picture. It looks like a vast grassland with mountains behind it. I used Google Lens to get the location. I saw a post and got the name of this place. It's located in Hokkaido and is called `Earth Garden`.

## **Flag:** `CRHC{N42.93_E142.86}`
