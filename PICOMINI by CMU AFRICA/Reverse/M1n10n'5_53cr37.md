# Solution

I was given an apk file called minion.apk, before I dismantled the program, I first installed the apk into my Android Studio emulator. After I installed it and opened it, it displayed a UI like this.

So in the UI we are given a picture of a cute Minion. And wait a minute, under the Minion picture, there is a sentence written:

> Look into me my Banana Value is interesting

because it tells us to check the banana value, let's open the jadx gui and check what the banana contains. Next in jadxgui I searched for all words containing the word `banana`

Well, in the image we can see in /res/value/strings.xml there is an interesting encoding. Come on, let's see the value

looks like this is the flag let's identify this encoding type

It turns out this is a type of base32 encoding. Next we decrypt it and get the flag
