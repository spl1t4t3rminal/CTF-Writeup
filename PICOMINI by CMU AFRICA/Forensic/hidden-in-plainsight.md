# Solution

I was given an image file with a jpg extension. I then checked using the `file` to verify that it was indeed a jpg. But I accidentally found something.

```bash
 zsh > file img.jpg
img.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, comment: "c3RlZ2hpZGU6Y0VGNmVuZHZjbVE9", baseline, precision 8, 640x640, components 3
```

you can see there is a section comment that contains base64 encoding. let's try to decode it. 

```bash
 zsh > echo 'c3RlZ2hpZGU6Y0VGNmVuZHZjbVE9' | base64 -d
steghide:cEF6endvcmQ=
```

Okay, there's an important clue next pointing to steghide and there's another base 64 encoding. Let's decode it again.

```zsh
 zsh > echo 'cEF6endvcmQ' | base64 -d
pAzzword% 
```

It seems that there is a password. We can assume that we have to extract an embedded data using the steghide and password.

```zsh
 zsh > steghide extract -sf img.jpg -p "pAzzword"
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".
```

and that's right let's read the file

```bash
 zsh > tail flag.txt
picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_1m4g3_e7f5b969}
```

# FLAG: picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_1m4g3_e7f5b969}
