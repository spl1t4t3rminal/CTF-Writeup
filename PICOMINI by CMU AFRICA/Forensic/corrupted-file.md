# Solution

We are given corrupted data. If we check the file type of the attachments, it will look like this.

```zsh
 zsh > file file
file: data
```

So let's try using xxd to check the bytes of this code.

```asm
 zsh > xxd file | head -5
00000000: 5c78 ffe0 0010 4a46 4946 0001 0100 0001  \x....JFIF......
00000010: 0001 0000 ffdb 0043 0008 0606 0706 0508  .......C........
00000020: 0707 0709 0908 0a0c 140d 0c0b 0b0c 1912  ................
00000030: 130f 141d 1a1f 1e1d 1a1c 1c20 242e 2720  ........... $.'
00000040: 222c 231c 1c28 3729 2c30 3134 3434 1f27  ",#..(7),01444.'
```

We can see there is a JFIF which indicates that this file is a JPEG. This is exactly the same as the hint given. and it appears that the prefix bit/signature of the file header has an error, this is what causes the file to be corrupted. JPEG should be built with the prefix byte `FF D8 FF EE`

We can find out all the list of signature header files on wikipedia. Here is the link.

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures
```

Next I will fix the header using a hex editor

let's replace those wrong bytes into this

then we save as using the .jpeg extension. then open the image and get the flag

# FLAG: picoCTF{r3st0r1ng_th3_by73s_efd8c6c0}
