**Description:** 
> We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out? The website is running here. Can you try to log in?

# Solution

<img width="1000" height="500" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb2b492-cd8d-4408-a29e-c4c399c8b2a5" />

A login UI is provided with an email and password entry form. This is where we enter data using the email address provided in the description and a dummy password.

if you click login. you will get this

I also checked the source code on this website and found a rot 13 encode in it.

If we decoder using cyber chef then the message will be like this

So there are a few tricks we can use. First, I tried to re-request by including X-Dev-Access in the header. and send it. You can see it on the right side of the response window. That's where the flag comes out.

or you can send req using curl like this

```zsh
 zsh > curl -s -X POST -H "X-Dev-Access: yes" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org","password":"test"}' \
  http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:59118/login

{"success":true,"email":"ctf-player@picoctf.org","firstName":"pico","lastName":"player","flag":"picoCTF{brut4_f0rc4_1a386e6f}"}%  
```
